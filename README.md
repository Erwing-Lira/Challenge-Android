I use the MVVM pattern for this this app, where each component has a function that I describe below.

`DataSource` - Request the information to the API. <br>
`Repository` - Manage the functions in charge of requesting the information. <br>
`ViewModel` - This class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. <br>

The home screen: <br>

When you have finished typing the CP that has 5 numbers, automatically the request to the API will be made to obtain the information and the polygon. <br>
