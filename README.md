# Challenge-Android
I use the MVVM pattern for this this app, where each component has a function that I describe below.

`DataSource` - Request the information to the API. <br>
`Repository` - Manages the functions in charge of requesting the information. <br>
`ViewModel` - class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. <br>
